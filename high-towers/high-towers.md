`High Towers: The Tower of Fields`
---
Be it for the sake of humanity's safety or for your own sanity, I recommend you not to read this (which is indeed an effective reverse psych.)

All I see is the high tower from a mile away. I wonder what is in it? How high must it be? But one thing's for sure: there are people in there. The tower flickers every night as though it has a heart of its own. I can see its every panel that is too glossy, edge too clean, window as clear as the crystal sky. But for all my life, I never thought of going near it. I figured it must stay alone. I have never met anyone that knows how to get there, the high tower that is elusive has been a wonder for us. As I walk near it, it gets far. The high tower, the moon, both behave the same: at night alive; illusory. Like a cat, no one beats a curious mind, and like a cat, I have been finding a way to get there. It only took me a day or two to encounter the mysterious guy from the woods. He said
> There are some that figured out the way. They maintain the tower for good. You are too young to have this decided for yourself. If by chance you find the way, there is no coming back. <i>A wisdom that is taught is a wisdom that should stay</i>. 

To which I replied that I am indeed decided. I already know the first time I saw the tower that I have to get there no matter what. It is about time that I decide for myself without the hurdles of my surrounding. And if not now, I don't know if there's a living chance for me still. And so he revealed

> In order for the woods to get itself cleared, you must understand the field. I refrain to be more ambiguous for your good so as to understand it wellâ€”the field of <i>real</i> and <i>rational</i> numbers is what I mean. 

With a reasonable confusion, I asked how will understanding fields of reals and rationals help me get there? He said, as though everyone whom he unfold this had asked the same question, in a decided manner

> In assumption that you understand the fields of reals and rationals, you must know the quadratic field extenstion to which the highest floor of the building belongs. The floor is $$3\sqrt{5 - 2\sqrt{5}}$$. More so, you must trace the tower of fields from the field of rationals (known as the first floor of such tower) up to the field of the said floor. If deemed correct, you will find the way. That is certain. 

By that moment, I already know what to do. My heart is bursting with the thought of walking in front of the tower, a centimeter close to it, with a gaze that is waiting to happen for years now. But I have to collect my thoughts, daydreaming won't help me significantly.
