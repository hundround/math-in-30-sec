`Some of the notable math bits I learned in my course thus far`
---
Ayooooo hi! 

This is `math-in-30-sec` where I discuss some of my favorite math topics and bits I learned either by leisure or by lecture (sighs).

You can navigate to different directories where the files are put, including (not exhaustive) notes in compiled $\LaTeX$ files and (i hope) some accompanying codes to illustrate such topics real fine. 

One of my favorite equations is $e^{i\pi} + 1 = 0$ called the <kbd>Euler's Equation</kbd> because it does change every year I analyze it. There is such a lot of ways can you read this equation and every one of them I assure is worth the time to analyze! For one, due to karma building up abnormally, I have taken <kbd>Complex Analysis</kbd> this semester and Euler's Equation again morphed into some sort of half-finished pizza (i.e. the <kbd>semicircle</kbd>). This is the first bit I'd like to discuss here! Look for `Half-finished Pizza: The Euler's Equation` below.

Anyway, I hope you'd learn something new here and in return, I hope that I'd ignite more the passion that is within me that is Math and its endless possibilities. Thanks for reading this!

Should you have any questions, feel free to connect with me through my email: <kbd>dorapa@up.edu.ph</kbd>
