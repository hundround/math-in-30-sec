`An Infinite Calendar: The Modulo`
---
In a far away land, so far that the gravity exists unstably, there was an advanced civilization more superior than that of earth. The people there have eyes that can identify an object even from a mile of distance. I don't know, maybe they needed it so thus evolution. Anyway, there's this kid named Tri. He has a class every <kbd>3rd</kbd> day of the week. Well, I forgot to say it but in their world, there are 12 days in a week; it is not <i>week</i> they call, it is <kbd>semaine</kbd>. 

If, by chance, he ever transferred to earth, things would be so disorienting for him. It's your responsibility, as his friend, to know what day of the week he should go to school had it been here on earth. Miraculously, you already know about <b>Modulo</b>!

Modulo had been useful for more than thousands of years solving countless problems involving numbers be it simple or complex. How do we do modulo? It's eaaaaaaaaaasy! Think of modulo as a function. We already know that a function has an input and an output. You should expect that the output of a modulo function is the exact remainder when you divide a number, say $k$, to another number, say $m$. Nomenclature-wise, it is $$k\bmod m = r.$$ The remainder denotes $r$.
